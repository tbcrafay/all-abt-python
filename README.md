<h1>Strengthen your Basics in programming in Python</h1>

<b>Remember to have solid understanding of the fundamentals of programming </b>

Anyone learning/reviewing, the basics/ fundamentals of python could take help from here.
By solving and practicing the problems and exercises, That will be published Here. 
Practice is the Key for perfection, stay motivated to learn and grow. You'll get there soon!! 


<h5>Before starting to learn from these make sure you have learnt fundamental topics in programming in python and are able to :</h5>

■ To write programs that perform simple computations (§2.2).
■ To obtain input from a program’s user by using the input function (§2.3).
■ To use identifiers to name elements such as variables and functions (§2.4).
■ To assign data to variables (§2.5).
■ To perform simultaneous assignment (§2.6).
■ To define named constants (§2.7).
■ To use the operators +, -, *, /, //, %, and ** (§2.8).
■ To write and evaluate numeric expressions (§2.9).
■ To use augmented assignment operators to simplify coding (§2.10).
■ To perform numeric type conversion and rounding with
  the int and round functions (§2.11).
■ To obtain the current system time by using time.time() (§2.12).
■ To describe the software development process and apply it to develop
 a loan payment program (§2.13).

<h5> after that, you should know: </h5>

built-in modules and functions, such as, eval, math module and random modules;
 &&
conditional statments and different types of operators

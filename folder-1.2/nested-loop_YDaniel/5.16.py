'''(Compute the greatest common divisor) For Listing 5.8, another solution to find
the greatest common divisor of two integers n1 and n2 is as follows: First find d to
be the minimum of n1 and n2, and then check whether d, d - 1, d - 2, ..., 2, or
1 is a divisor for both n1 and n2 in this order. The first such common divisor is the
greatest common divisor for n1 and n2'''

#  we'll see that later...
